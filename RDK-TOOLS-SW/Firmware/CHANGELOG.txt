# Changelog

## 2.5.5

- Added support for Avian E silicon

## 2.5.4

- Added virtual readout address for detections of LTR11

## 2.5.3

- Allow to configure up to 4 interrupts simultaneously in the data interface
- Fixed 2nd shield connector pin definition
- Fixed 2nd shield connector detection bug

## 2.5.2

- Fixed MCU Rev. A I2C clear bus workaround
- Added additional LED error code for error during detection of shield/radar chip

## 2.5.1

- Added hard-reset before detecting Avian chips
- Added batch functionality to register interface
- Fixed LED color for undetected shield error

## 2.5.0

- Added support for additional devices: ATR22 and LTR11
- Refactored shield detection due to different types of shields without EEPROM:
  1) Check for shield connector error
    mirrored connection can only be detected if the shield has I2C pull-ups
    other unexpected levels on OC pins are interpreted as unsupported shield connection
  2) Check presence of known devices using SPI and I2C
    Try reading the chip ID of Avian, if successful, instantiate its driver
    Else try reading the chip ID of LTR11, if successful, instantiate its driver
    Else try reading the chip ID of ATR22, if successful, instantiate its driver
  3) Continue with normal initialization, so that even without a detected chip, I2C, SPI, GPIO, etc. are usable

## 2.4.0

- Improved performance of Avian data handling
- I2c and shield connector interfaces modified to support multiple buses
- Changes to Avian interface for FW-only use (which break compatibility to previous version)

## 2.3.0

- Refactored SPI interface: Implementation now supports both single and quad
  SPI.
- The LED indicates error states as documented in Application Note 599.
- chrono_microseconds now rounds up. This fixes problems when the desired time
  is smaller than the time resolution available.
- Fixed FIFO underflows caused by pending BGT interrupts.
- A dedicated command interface for Avian devices is used now instead of the
  generic register interface. This avoids modifying data in memory before sending
  it to an Avian device, making it also easier to store config sequences directly
  in static memory.

## 2.2.0

- Fixed race condition that caused sending corrupted data to the host.

## 2.1.0

- Changes to packing/unpacking of radar data which break compatibility to
  previous version.

## 2.0.1

Switched from commlib to Strata. Please note that the versions 1.x and 2.x are
incompatible.

## 1.1.6

- Support for BGT60UTR11.

## 1.1.5

- BGT60LTR11:
    * After successfull initialization, the LED of the RadarBaseboardMCU7 is
      now green.
    * In pulse mode and with external ADCs (of the RadarBaseboardMCU7) the sample
      is read from the LTR11 now about 50us after the end of the pulse.
    * The scaling of the raw data has been changed.

## 1.1.4

- Updated driver to 0.8.14: It is now possible to disable all antennas in a
  chirp
- BGT60LTR11 now starts in pulse mode

## 1.1.3

- Updated driver to 0.8.13: Added support for BGT60TR11D
- Bugfix: Fixed swapped idle and deep sleep parameter update

## 1.1.2

- BGT60LTR11: various bugfixes

## 1.1.1

- BGT60LTR11
  * Support for selecting ADC source (ADCs of either RadarbaseBoardMCU7 or
    BGT60LTR11)
  * Startup settings have been changed to increase sensitivity
  * Bugfix: Movements (e.g. waving a hand) over the sensor while starting the
    data acquisition do no longer cause problems.
  * Bugfix: LEDs now work properly if LTR11 shield is mounted on the backside.

## 1.1.0

- Initial support for BGT60LTR11
  * The NVM of the BGT60LTR11 has to be initialized with the correct board id
    or the BGT60LTR11 will not work.
  * BGT60TRxx are not required to have the correct board id written in the NVM
    yet. This might change in a future version.
- BoardSupplementalEndpoint is now always exported
- Driver has been upgraded to 0.8.12: Fixed rounding of test tone frequency

## 1.0.9

-  RF frequency limitation added to ensure to be within legal limits

## 1.0.8

- Increased Driver to 0.8.9: Fixed not-working RF power measurement

## 1.0.7

- The bootloader endpoint is now always exported, even if no shield is attached
  or the shield is mirrored. This allows to flash the Hatvan board if no shield
  is attached or the shield is mirrored.

## 1.0.6

- Bugfix and shorter update times for ATR24C.

## 1.0.5

- Support for BGT60ATR24

## 1.0.4

- Harware major number is now set to 2 by default

## 1.0.3

- Added support for enabling/disabling the power of the radar shield
